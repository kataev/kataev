### Hello, I'm Denis Kataev, a Python developer 🐍, manager 🎯, and public speaker 🗣️. 

- I have created some open source projects, such as the [flake8](https://github.com/flake8-docs/flake8-rst) module for documentation and the pytest [grps](https://github.com/kataev/pytest-grpc) module.
- I have a great affinity for the Python 🐍, though it does have one potential drawback: speed. However, this issue can be remedied by incorporating my second favorite language, Rust 🦀.
- I enjoy working with databases and related tools, such as the SQLAlchemy ORM, I have delivered a series of talks at PyCon Russia on this topic.
- Currently, I'm learning about causal inference and Bayesian statistics 🎲.
- I'm inspired by cool visualizations and strive to explain complex ideas through simple visual language 📈.

I curate interesting projects on my [stars page](https://github.com/kataev?tab=stars), which I've categorized into four areas of interest (mostly in Python):
- 🗄 databases (tools and algorithms)
- 🙆‍♂️ modeling (ML and NLP)
- 📈 visualization (rare and cool graphs)
- ✨ inspiration (interesting projects that I'm excited to apply)

If you enjoyed this, feel free to follow me here to stay updated on new stars!
