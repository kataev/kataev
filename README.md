### Hello, I'm Denis Kataev, a Python developer 🐍, manager 🎯, and public speaker 🗣️. 

- I have created some open source projects, such as the [flake8](https://github.com/flake8-docs/flake8-rst) module for documentation and the pytest module for [grps](https://github.com/kataev/pytest-grpc) testing. 
- I enjoy working with databases and database tools, such as the SQLAlchemy ORM. 
- Currently, I'm learning about causal inference and Bayesian statistics 🎲. 
- I'm inspired by cool visualizations and strive to explain complex ideas through simple visual language 📈. 

I curate interesting projects on my [stars page](https://github.com/kataev?tab=stars), which I've categorized into four areas of interest (mostly in Python):
- 🗄 databases (Tools and algorithms)
- 🙆‍♂️ modeling (ML and NLP)
- 📈 visualization (rare and cool graphs)
- ✨ inspiration (interesting projects that I'm excited to apply)"

If you enjoyed this, feel free to follow me here to stay updated on new stars!
