### Hello, I'm Denis Kataev, a Python developer 🐍, manager 🎯, and public speaker 🗣️. 

- I have contributed to open source projects, such as the flake8 module for documentation and the pytest module for grp testing. 
- I enjoy working with databases and database tools, such as the SQLAlchemy ORM. 
- Currently, I'm learning about causal inference and Bayesian statistics 🎲. 
- I'm inspired by cool visualizations and strive to explain complex ideas through simple visual language 📈. 
- You can watch my talks in Russian on YouTube. You're also welcome to visit my LinkedIn page.

I curate interesting projects on my stars (mostly in Python), which I've categorized into four areas of interest:
- 🗄 databases (my favorites)
- 🙆‍♂️ modeling (ML and NLP)
- 📈 visualization (rare and cool graphs)
- ✨ inspiration (interesting projects that I'm excited to apply)"

You can follow to me here to be aware of new additions!
